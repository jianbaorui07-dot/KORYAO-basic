# StarBridge Photoshop MCP

## Core Rule

Treat Photoshop as a local authorized desktop app with private user assets. Prefer StarBridge read-only probes, document summaries, recipe plans, and validation before any GUI action or export.

Do not open private PSD files, scan source-image folders, run arbitrary JSX/BatchPlay, save/export real artwork, read Creative Cloud cache, or write outside approved sandbox output.

## Read First

Read only what is needed:

- `examples/photoshop_bridge/README.md`
- `docs/03-codex-photoshop.md`
- `docs/photoshop-codex-bridge.md`
- `starbridge_mcp/adapters/photoshop/`
- `starbridge_mcp/core/tool_registry.py`
- `tests/test_photoshop_*.py`
- `docs/adobe-mcp-github-research.md` only when comparing outside projects

If changing shared MCP behavior, also read `.codex/skills/starbridge-mcp/SKILL.md`.

## Safe Commands

```powershell
npm.cmd run photoshop:diagnose
npm.cmd run photoshop:info
python -m starbridge_mcp.server tools --json --safe-only
python examples\bridge_status.py --json --redact-paths --soft-exit
python -m unittest discover -s tests
python scripts\security_check.py
```

Use `npm.cmd`, not bare `npm`, on Windows PowerShell.

## Tool Routing

| Need | Preferred tool path | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Check availability | `ps.probe`, `photoshop.session_info` | Read-only, no PSD open |
| Inspect active document | `ps.document.info`, `photoshop.document_info` | Active document only, no save/export |
| Inspect layers | `ps.layers.list` | Layer tree summary only |
| Validate BatchPlay | `ps.batchplay.validate` | Validate descriptors, never execute arbitrary BatchPlay |
| Plan actions | `photoshop.recipe_list`, `photoshop.recipe_plan` | Dry-run first |
| Validate recipe | `photoshop.recipe_validate` | Check manifest and sandbox paths |
| Debug recipe | `photoshop.recipe_debug` | Return guidance only |

## Write Rules

Any real Photoshop write/export must require:

- `confirm_write=true` or `confirm_export=true`
- sandbox output under ignored output directories
- sanitized JSON result
- declared expected output files
- EvidenceManifest entry
- no absolute user path in returned text

Never add a raw "execute script" tool. Add audited recipe-level actions instead.

## Validation

After Photoshop MCP changes, run:

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s tests
python scripts\starbridge_preflight.py --markdown
python scripts\security_check.py
python -m starbridge_mcp.server tools --json --safe-only
npm.cmd test
```

Report local Photoshop as unavailable if it is not installed, not licensed, not open, or not reachable through COM/UXP. Do not turn that into pass.
